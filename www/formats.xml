<page title="Formats">
	<p>RECOIL understands <formats-count /> file formats, including:</p>
	<formats-index />
	<p>The formats are listed below, ordered by the origin computer family
	and the filename extension. Alternative extensions are comma-separated.</p>
	<p>Some pictures are composed of multiple files - they must share their filename
	and only differ by their extensions.
	Such formats are listed here with the plus sign combining the extensions.
	Some ports of RECOIL do not support multi-file pictures.</p>
	<p>Some graphics programs weren't enforcing any filename extension.
	I have chosen an arbitrary one for these formats.</p>
	<p>"2 frames" means the picture is composed of two quickly alternating frames
	so that a human eye perceives more colors
	(for example black alternated with light gray looks like dark gray).
	On Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 this technique is commonly (but incorrectly)
	referred to as the "interlace". On ZX Spectrum it is called "gigascreen".
	Likewise, "3 frames" means three different alternating pictures
	at the cost of increased flickering.
	RECOIL displays such pictures by averaging all frames into a static image.</p>
	<p>You can find some sample files in
	<a href="http://recoil.sourceforge.net/examples.zip">examples.zip</a>.
	This is the collection of my test files, so they are often interesting
	because of the underlying encoding, rather than the visual effect.</p>
