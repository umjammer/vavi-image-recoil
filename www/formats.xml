	<p>RECOIL understands <formats-count /> file formats, including:</p>
	<formats-index />
	<p>Formats are listed below by origin computer family and filename extension.
	Alternative extensions are comma-separated.</p>
	<p>Some pictures are composed of multiple files - they must share their filename
	and only differ by their extensions.
	Such formats are listed here with the plus sign combining the extensions.
	Some ports of RECOIL don't support multi-file pictures.</p>
	<p>Some graphics programs didn't enforce any filename extension.
	I have chosen an arbitrary one for these formats.</p>
	<p>"2 frames" means the picture is composed of two quickly alternating frames so that
	a human perceives more colors (for example black alternated with gray looks like dark gray).
	On Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 this technique is commonly (but incorrectly)
	referred to as "interlace". On ZX Spectrum it is called "gigascreen".
	Likewise, "3 frames" means three different alternating pictures and more flickering.
	RECOIL displays such pictures by averaging frames into a static image.</p>
	<p>You can find some sample files in
	<a href="http://recoil.sourceforge.net/examples.zip">examples.zip</a>.
	This is the collection of my test files, so they are often interesting
	because of the underlying encoding, rather than the visual effect.</p>
