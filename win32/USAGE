How to install and use
----------------------

Recommended installation method is to use the installer package.
However, you can also install specific components of FAIL manually.

fail2png::
Extract `fail2png.exe` to a directory of your choice
(for convenience, this directory should be included in your `Path` environment variable).
+
Run the program from command line to see the syntax.
Unless you specify the `-o`/`--output` option, the output filename will be
constructed from the input filename with the extension changed to `png`.

FAILWin::
Extract `failwin.exe` to a directory of your choice.
+
Usage instructions are needless, it's a typical Windows application.

XnView plugin::
Extract `Xfail1.usr`, `Xfail2.usr`, `Xfail3.usr`, `Xfail4.usr`, `Xfail5.usr`
and `Xfail6.usr` to the `Plugins` directory of your XnView installation.
If XnView crashes when started, try removing the `Plugins` section
from `%APPDATA%\XnView\xnview.ini`.

ImageMagick coder::
Extract `IM_MOD_RL_fail_.dll` to the `modules\coders` directory of your
ImageMagick installation.

Note: ImageMagick coder is built for `Q16 dll` version of ImageMagick
(the one that is recommended by its authors). If you have installed another
version, you will need to download and install the right build of ImageMagick,
or to build FAIL coder from source using configuration of your ImageMagick
installation.
