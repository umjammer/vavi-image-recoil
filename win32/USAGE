How to install and use
----------------------

fail2png::
Extract `fail2png.exe` to a directory of your choice
(for convenience, this directory should be included in your `Path` environment variable).
+
Run the program from command line to see the syntax.
Unless you specify the `-o`/`--output` option, the output filename will be
constructed from the input filename with the extension changed to `png`.

FAILWin::
Extract `failwin.exe` to a directory of your choice.
+
Usage instructions are needless, it's a typical Windows application.

XnView plugin::
For versions <1.80, extract `Xfail.dll` to the `PluginsEx` directory
of your XnView installation.
For versions >=1.80, extract `Xfail.dll` to the `Plugins` directory
of your XnView installation, then rename it to `Xfail.usr`.
